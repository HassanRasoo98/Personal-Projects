# Time Table Reader
This python script is intented to bring automation to the student's timetable making process to some extent. This application was developed for CS Department of FAST NUCES Islamabad. 

# Importance:
To understand the importance of this project let me give you some background of the problem. If you download and see the 'TimeTable, FSC, Spring-2023.xlsx' file you can see the hectic timeslots and classes schedules. All Students have to make their timetables by manually finding the subjects they are enrolled in and the classes schedules and room numbers from the file. Then they have to repeat this process for 5 different subjects for 5 days of the week and they also have to avoid their clashes (regular students typically don't face these problems but they're also rare in FAST). I have seen countless number of students in my environment doing the whole process manually on their registers. 
  What this app will do is to ease this entire process just by taking the subject list as input from the user. It will then return the timetable including days, timeslots, room numbers, subject names, sections along with the stauts whether there is a clash in the timetable or not.

# Ideas I have to improve this project:
  Still there is a lot of improvement that can be made in this application. For example, one can develop a mobile app which will make the process a lot more easier. That is because everyone does not have a python environment to run the script. Secondly, we can generate a clash-free timetable for the user ourselves by using AI techniques such as Genetic Algorithm etc.

# Thank you
